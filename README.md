**Chapter 3 Genetics: Cells and Molecules**

In this revision of the testbank, all of the questions have been updated to reflect changes in Exploring Biological Anthropology, 3e. There is also a new system for identifying the difficulty of the questions. In this revision, the questions are now tagged according to the four levels of learning that help organize the text. Think of these four levels as moving from lower-level to higher-level cognitive reasoning. The four levels are:

REMEMBER: a question involving recall of key terms or factual material
UNDERSTAND: a question testing comprehension of more complex ideas
APPLY: a question applying anthropological knowledge to some new situation
ANALYZE: a question requiring identifying elements of an argument and their interrelationship
